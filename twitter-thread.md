# AI Product Replacement Twitter Thread - Casual Human Tone

## Tweet 1/11 (Casual Hook) [268 chars]
Been messing around with AI image generation lately. You can make incredible product ads... except the "product" isn't actually yours. It's whatever the AI imagines. 

So I built something to fix this... üßµ

2/ The thing is, most AI tools have zero clue what your actual product looks like. 

You either spend 6 hours describing it in prompts or get some random AI thing that looks nothing like yours. Pretty useless for real businesses.

3/ Got frustrated so I threw together a solution using AI Studio. 

Honestly, AI Studio is insane - I just described what I wanted in plain English and it built the whole React app for me. Wild stuff.

4/ So I started testing existing solutions. Flux is the only one that lets you upload 4 reference images of your actual product.

Finally! Now it knows what I'm selling...

Except I only got decent results 1 out of 8 times. That's rough. üìä

5/ You might think "eh, 1/8 isn't terrible..."

But I'm not gonna sit there checking if it messed up 7 out of 8 times. And you definitely don't want to retry this 20 times a day just to get one good ad.

Doesn't scale at all.

## Tweet 6/11 (Nanobanana Good) [278 chars]
6/ Turns out nanobanana (Gemini) is actually really good at this stuff when you give it reference images.

There's all this hype around it for a reason. It's way more consistent than other models when you need it to stick to what you show it. üî•

## Tweet 7/11 (My Solution) [267 chars]
7/ Built a simple 4-step thing:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Check if your product photos are decent quality
2Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure it won't do dumb stuff (like turning 1 shoe into 2)
3Ô∏è‚É£ Do the actual replacement using nanobanana
4Ô∏è‚É£ Quick quality check at the end

## Tweet 8/11 (Logic Thing) [276 chars]
8/ The cool part: even when the output isn't perfect, the logic stays consistent. 

Like if you're replacing one sneaker, it won't randomly make it two sneakers. That step 2 logic check seems to stick even if other stuff changes. Pretty neat.

## Tweet 9/11 (Results) [259 chars]
9/ Tested it against Flux:

Flux: 12.5% decent results  
My thing: Way more consistent (not perfect, but logical)

GitHub: [URL] - just swap in your Gemini API key in the .env file and you can test it yourself.

Built entirely with AI Studio.

## Tweet 10/11 (What's Next) [264 chars]
10/ Thinking about adding:
‚Ä¢ Auto background cleanup for crappy product photos
‚Ä¢ Better scene understanding 
‚Ä¢ Even smarter nanobanana prompting

Just a side project for now, but reference-based AI is getting pretty interesting. üöÄ
